## Introduction

Hey there! 👋 I'm Frederick, a self-taught data engineer at Google! 💻💡 I used to be your classic finance bro, having had internships in Investment Banking, FP&A, Private Equity, and pretty much everything finance-related. 💸

After college, I started my career in a Finance Rotational Program... and that's when I stumbled upon the magic of data! 🚀 Now, I'm a data engineer on a central StratOps team, collaborating with super talented folks from Recruiting, Finance, and Engineering teams. 🎯
